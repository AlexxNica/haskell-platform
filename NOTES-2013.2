NOTES-2013.2


[] need to inform folks that I'm going to publish a database with their e-mail
[] need a way to collect release notes
[] what do we do about API changes? Should the HP have multiple versions of a
    package? like when syb goes from 0.3.7 to 0.4.0 - that's an API change
[] automated collection of package info? google form? web site?
[] tests?!?!?!?!!!!

[] library maintainer responsibilities?
    - subscribe to haskell-platform@ or do we need a new address
    - version number hygene
    - working e-mail contact, provision for leaves
    - release notes
    - don't break the API
    - don't change the API needlessly
    - commitment to stability
    - build no warnings... please?

BUILD

[] support for build from dist-build
    [x] make file doesn't unpack without explicit target
    [] should move dist build package building code into makefile(?)

[x] something left a file named '*.conf' in the package.conf.d
    which broke the source step - removing it got us a little closer
    - didn't happen on rebuild, so not investigated

[] craziness with GHC_PACKAGE_PATH in build.sh

[x] why did platform.packages have extensible-exceptions-0.1.1.4?
    ==> because cgi-3001.1.7.4. required it!


[x] needed to add to the Makefile
    export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.7

[x] still have the bug that cabal update does it twice the first time
    - fixed!

[x] cabal doc is missing
    [x] run the following (requires pandoc on PATH)
    $ git clone --depth 5 --branch Cabal-v1.16.0 \
            git://github.com/haskell/cabal.git cabal-1.16.0
    $ cd cabal-1.16.0/Cabal
    $ make users-guide
    [x] result is in dist/doc/users-guide
    [x] copy this as dist-<arch>/root/Library/Framekworks/GHC.framework/Versions/<ver>/usr/share/doc/ghc/html/Cabal
